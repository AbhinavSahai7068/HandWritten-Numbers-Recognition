# HandWritten-Numbers-Recognition

In this project I am Recognising Handwritten Digits on MNIST Dataset using K Nearest Nieghbours. 
KNN can be define as: K-nearest neighbors (kNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression tasks. 
I see kNN as an algorithm that comes from real life. People tend to be effected by the people around them.
Our behaviour is guided by the friends we grew up with. Our parents also shape our personality in some ways. 
If you grow up with people who love sports, it is higly likely that you will end up loving sports. There are ofcourse exceptions. kNN works similarly.

kNN classifier determines the class of a data point by majority voting principle.
If k is set to 5, the classes of 5 closest points are checked. Prediction is done according to the majority class. 
Similarly, kNN regression takes the mean value of 5 closest points.


Here
x_train are features for training the algorithm and y_train are right answers for training
x_test are features for testing the algorithm while y_test are right answers.
